; o Remarks - these are lines beginning with a semi-colon (;) they are completely ignored.
; o 1 ORG line - gives the origin of the code; this is the startingaddress to be used for the disassembly.
; o COMMENT lines - used to add comments to the end of lines of the disassembly.
; o COMMENTLINE lines - provide full-line comments to be included before a given address in the disassembly.
; o DATA lines - mark sections as data.  These sections will not be disassembled, but dumped as hex data instead.
; o ASCII lines - mark sections as text.  These sections will not be disassembled, but printed as text instead.
;
; current limitations:
; o number of LABEL, DATA/ASCII, COMMENT and COMMENTLINE lines determined at compile-time - see MAXLABEL, MAXDATA, MAXCOMMENT and MAXCOMMLINE
; o all DATA/ASCII lines in data file must be sorted in ascending address order
; o ditto for COMMENT and COMMENTLINE lines
; o if a DATA/ASCII area is preceded by what Z80dasm thinks is code that continues into the DATA/ASCII area, the data will not be marked
;   as such, and an error will be printed.  If this is the case, mark the line before the data as data also.
